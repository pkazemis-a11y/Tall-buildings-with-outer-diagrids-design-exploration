## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-19

### Added
- Initial release of the database
- 1,000 building models with outer diagrids
- 7 ground motion analyses per building (7,000 total records)

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Wind loading analysis (future work)
- Material nonlinearity extensions (future work)
- Additional ground motion records (future work)
- Time-series feature analysis (future work)
